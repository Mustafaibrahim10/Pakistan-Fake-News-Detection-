# Pakistan-Fake-News-Detection

This project implements a Pakistan Fake News Detection Model using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as Real or Fake. The model is trained on English-language news related to Pakistani politics and current affairs, focusing on identifying misleading or false information from textual content.

The workflow includes text preprocessing with lemmatization, feature extraction using TF-IDF and Word2Vec and a structured pipeline for efficient training and evaluation. A Logistic Regression classifier is used due to its effectiveness and interpretability in text classification tasks.
